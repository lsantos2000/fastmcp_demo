[Uses calculate tool: 0.25 * 80 = 20.0]
25% of 80 is 20.

You: "If I invest $1000 at 5% annual interest, what's the simple interest after 3 years?"

Claude: Simple interest formula is I = P × r × t, where P=principal, r=rate, t=time.
[Uses calculate tool: 1000 * 0.05 * 3 = 150.0]
The simple interest after 3 years would be $150.
```

#### **Scientific Calculations**
```
You: "What's the kinetic energy of a 2kg object moving at 10 m/s?"

Claude: I'll use the kinetic energy formula KE = ½mv².
[Uses calculate tool: 0.5 * 2 * 10**2 = 100.0]
The kinetic energy is 100 joules.

You: "Convert 100°F to Celsius"

Claude: I'll use the formula C = (F - 32) × 5/9.
[Uses calculate tool: (100 - 32) * 5/9 = 37.78]
100°F equals approximately 37.78°C.
```
